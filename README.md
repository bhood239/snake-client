# Snake Client Project

Snake game is one of the most popular games ever. The concept has a player moving around the screen and eating in order to grow. As it continues to grow, it becomes it's own obstacle. The goal is for the player to grow as large as possible without hitting the side of the screen or the body of the player, in which case the player loses.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here: https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer
